# ReSizer
A simple GUI tool to help you manage the images in your cross-platform applications. This tool is inspired by [DownSize](https://github.com/ChaseFlorell/Downsize) infact I am using it's logging and image convertion code, So kind of a new updated version of DownSize. 

###Contributing###

Altough I have tried to make this tool simple and easy to use but it might be missing feature X, or platform Y. If you want something that it can't currently provide, I love pull requests. If it's a bigger change, you can also create new tool using this code like I did with this tool.
